- I explored **Three.js** to try a 3D rendering... before coming back to something more minimal, cleaner.
- I struggled with **Stockfish.js**, figuring out how to make it work, handling the AI, legal moves, and error states.
- I built the UI with **React**, **Tailwind**, and **Vite** to get something fast, modern, and clean.
- I tweaked and tested until the pieces moved properly, errors were handled, and **Pr.HakilIA** could start commenting my mistakes like a real coach.

## ðŸŽ¯ What it really is

**MathisChess** is:
- A chess game **playable against an AI or another local player**.
- An interface inspired by Chess.com â€” simple and readable.
- A visible AI coach on screen: **Pr.HakilIA**, who tells you why your move was goodâ€¦ or not.
- A system with **learning-based feedback**, a **move history**, and an **estimated ELO rating**.

This repo contains the first version of **MathisChess**, ready to be tested, improved, or remixed.  
Feel free to clone, play, contribute â€” or just explore and see whatâ€™s inside.

**PS:** This is a very incomplete version.  
Thanks to **OpenAI** and **Bolt** for the help.

 *Dedicated to the love of my life, Luna I love you.*
